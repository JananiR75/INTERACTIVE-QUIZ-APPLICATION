**DESCRIPTION**:

The interactive quiz application is a simple, user-friendly web project built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to test usersâ€™ knowledge across various topics through a series of multiple-choice questions, providing real-time feedback and score tracking. The application runs completely in the browser without requiring any backend or database, making it lightweight and easy to deploy.

The structure of the application is created using HTML, which defines the layout of the quiz interface including question containers, answer options, navigation buttons, and score display areas. CSS is used to style the application, making it visually appealing and responsive across different screen sizes. Elements such as buttons, cards, and progress bars are styled to improve the user experience and ensure the interface remains clean and intuitive.

The core logic of the quiz is handled using JavaScript. All questions, options, and correct answers are stored in JavaScript arrays or objects. JavaScript dynamically updates the content on the page as users interact with the quiz. It handles user input, validates answers, updates the score, and shows feedback after each question. Features like next/previous navigation, question timers, and progress indicators can be implemented to enhance interactivity.

The application supports multiple domains or categories of questions, and users can navigate between them using return or back options. Cumulative score tracking is implemented using JavaScript variables, and a final result summary is displayed at the end of the quiz to show overall performance. Optional features like random question order, timed quizzes, or themed color modes (e.g., dark mode) can also be added to improve functionality and engagement.

No external libraries or frameworks are used in this project, making it ideal for beginners learning the core concepts of web development. It can be easily hosted on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static web hosting service. Resources for development include browser developer tools for testing, free icons and fonts for styling, and sample question sets for quiz content.

This project demonstrates a strong understanding of the fundamentals of front-end web development and is an excellent addition to a portfolio. It showcases skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, styling, and interactive UI creation using only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
